# eyy it's my freakin neovim config
after 5 years of doomemacs it's time to move to the new hotness, neovim
no way in hell i'm gonna learn emacs lisp, lua is a-ok even with 1-based indexing
starting from the kickstart modular config, stealing the parts that I liked from doom
(and not using the doom nvim distro, that's the biggest 'missing the point' project i've ever seen lmao)
i think i'll stick with tmux for project splits, one fewer dependency
